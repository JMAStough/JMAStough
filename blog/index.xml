      <description>Summary  Download and unzip GZDoom Download and unzip game files Copy WAD files to GZDoom folder Start the Game Edit control settings Enjoy!  Materials Needed  A Windows computer (all software used here is compatible with Win, Mac, and Linux, but instructions will be Windows-specific) An internet connection A mouse with a scroll wheel (controlling a first-person shooter with a trackpad is doable, but makes playing a lot more difficult)  Introduction In my last post, I explained why I think that the original 1993 Doom is a good first choice if you are interested in learning how to play video games for the first time, especially on the computer as opposed to a video game console.</description>

      <description>Take-home points  Doom is a great introduction to video games Gameplay is simple and easy to learn The difficulty can be adjusted to your abilities The first episode is free and publicly available There is a ton of fan-made content available for free online The software will run on just about anything  OK, so why Doom? If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of any PC video games in your life, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance that they include The Sims, Minecraft, or Doom.</description>
