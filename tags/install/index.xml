      <description>Summary  Download and unzip GZDoom Download and unzip game files Copy WAD files to GZDoom folder Start the Game Edit control settings Enjoy!  Materials Needed  A Windows computer (all software used here is compatible with Win, Mac, and Linux, but instructions will be Windows-specific) An internet connection A mouse with a scroll wheel (controlling a first-person shooter with a trackpad is doable, but makes playing a lot more difficult)  Introduction In my last post, I explained why I think that the original 1993 Doom is a good first choice if you are interested in learning how to play video games for the first time, especially on the computer as opposed to a video game console.</description>
